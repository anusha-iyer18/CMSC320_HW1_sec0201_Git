Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Using Git can be helpful for version control, as you can keep track of the changes that you make through 
commit history, as Git keeps track of your code base over time, and that can be helpful to go back to so that you
can review, revise, or revert back to certain changes that assisted with your goal. Git is also useful for collaborating,
because you can maintain a central remote repository for your code base, and each developer can make their own branches
to work on different features without conflicting with anyone else's development, and then those changes can be pushed from
their local repository to the remote one to be viewed and reviewed by other developers for feedback and approval.
