Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: One field that data science could be applied to is the healthcare field. As data scientists are able to gather, transform,
and analyze data, and also develop and produce models using machine learning and programming, this can be applied towards healthcare
data to extract important insights from datasets that can help healthcare professionals. These datasets can include things like
tracking diseases, outbreaks, population health characteristics/determinants, and health risks that exist in the population. The
resulting models and insights can help healthcare professionals make predictions on future outcomes or risks for the population's health,
and the results from the data analysis can help better inform what decisions healthcare professionals make to help the general population
and improve overall health.
