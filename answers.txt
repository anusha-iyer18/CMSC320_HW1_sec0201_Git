Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Using Git can be helpful for version control, as you can keep track of the changes that you make through 
commit history, as Git keeps track of your code base over time, and that can be helpful to go back to so that you
can review, revise, or revert back to certain changes that assisted with your goal. Git is also useful for collaborating,
because you can maintain a central remote repository for your code base, and each developer can make their own branches
to work on different features without conflicting with anyone else's development, and then those changes can be pushed from
their local repository to the remote one to be viewed and reviewed by other developers for feedback and approval.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: One field that data science could be applied to is the healthcare field. As data scientists are able to gather, transform,
and analyze data, and also develop and produce models using machine learning and programming, this can be applied towards healthcare
data to extract important insights from datasets that can help healthcare professionals. These datasets can include things like
tracking diseases, outbreaks, population health characteristics/determinants, and health risks that exist in the population. The
resulting models and insights can help healthcare professionals make predictions on future outcomes or risks for the population's health,
and the results from the data analysis can help better inform what decisions healthcare professionals make to help the general population
and improve overall health.
